Singleton Design Pattern is a pattern where we want to instantiate our object only one time.
Steps to achieve SDP
1. Declare one private static instance Object.
2. Create one private Constructor
3. Create one public  get method (with one parameter)
4. inside method put if object == null {
  do some action;
  return object 
}
